# ecomping-nue

A replica of Contabo's [ecomping-nue/ping API](https://ecomping-nue.contabo.net/ping) built using Node.js, Express, and Axios.

## About

- **source_ip**: The client's IP address.
- **latency_ms**: The latency in milliseconds.
- **time**: The current time in ISO 8601 format.

This project is built with [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and uses [Axios](https://axios-http.com/) for making HTTP requests.
